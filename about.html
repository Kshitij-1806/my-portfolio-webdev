        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <img src="me.jpeg" class="img-left" alt="Kshitij">
        <p>I am a student currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at Vellore Institute of Technology. I have a strong interest in technology and I hope to become a successful entrepreneur in the future. I enjoy learning new programming languages like C++ and Python, and I am always looking for new projects to build.</p>
        <p>I am originally from a background where I spent a lot of time experimenting with computers. Moving to VIT has been a great experience because I get to meet people who have the same goals as I do. I am excited to see where my engineering journey takes me.</p>

                <img src="me1.jpeg" class="img-right" alt="Pool">
                One of my biggest hobbies is video editing. I find it very satisfying to take raw clips and turn them into something meaningful. It requires a lot of patience and attention to detail, which are skills I also use when I am coding.

                I also love to play Badminton, I enjoy the sport alot and love to play it whenever I get time to play, I also love to play pool along with my friends.

                <img src="hobby2.jpg" class="img-right" alt="Coding">
                Finally, I enjoy spending my free time practicing coding logic. Whether it is solving problems on LeetCode or building small tools for my own use, I find the process of logical problem-solving very rewarding.
